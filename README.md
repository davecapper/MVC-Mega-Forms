# MVC-Mega-Forms
Additional components to make awesome forms in ASP.NET MVC

## Note for ChangeVisually users
If you use a custom element to group controls (instead of any of the HtmlHelper extensions) with ChangeVisually, ensure the control group has a data-val-changevisually-container="true" attribute
e.g.
```html
<div class="form-row" data-val-changevisually-container="true">
....
</div>
```
